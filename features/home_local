# The `${HOME}/.local` Directory

I try to follow the XDG Standard. Call it pedantic, but it works. Several things are therefore mirrored:

| Regular Directory | `${HOME}/.local` |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `/bin`            | `${HOME}/.local/bin` |
| `/usr/share`      | `${HOME}/.local/share` |
