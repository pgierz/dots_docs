Provides a quick-access CLI interface for Cisco Anyconnect and any VPN
binary which provides the [connect]{.title-ref} and
[disconnect]{.title-ref} subcommands. This has **only** been tested on
Cisco Anyconnect!

# Usage:

``` console
```

\$ vpn.sh on Will connect to \${VPN_SERVER} \$ vpn.sh off Will
disconnect to \${VPN_SERVER} \$ vpn.sh test Will print to screen an
example file with user credentials which would be piped to the
\${VPN_BIN} program

# Arguments:

`$1` : `string`

`on`, `connect` or `off`, `disconnect` to connect or disconnect. Use
`test` to determine if the file containing the user information and
password is being correctly written.

# Optional Files:

\${PASSWORD_INFO_FILE} : This file contains user name and password
information. Defaults to \${HOME}/.config/cisco/login_info.txt. This can
be set via environment variable, please see the next section.

# Environment Variables:

`${VPN_BIN}` :

Location of the vpn program to use (e.g. Cisco Anyconnect) Defaults to
`/opt/cisco/secureclient/bin/vpn`

`${VPN_SERVER}` :

The server address to connect to. Defaults to vpn.awi.de

`${PASSWORD_INFO_FILE}` :

File with username and password information in the following format:

``` console
```

\$ cat \${PASSWORD_INFO_FILE} \<user_name\> \<password\> y

Defaults to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=${HOME}/.config}/cisco/login_info.txt`,
each entry should be on a separate line.

Note that the final `y` in this file is \"yes\", to accept the security
disclaimer automatically.

If such a file is not available, tries to use the `${HOME}/.netrc file`
